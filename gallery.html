                <h1>INFANT</h1>
                <p>The sweet African elephant calf is drinking water in a river. It has its half trunk in the water. On the body of the elephant calf, you see a water line of how deep it was in the water before. The darker bottom is due to the wetness from the river, while the upper body is still dry and light grey.</p>
